# Implementation Plan for Rust + V8 SSR Service

This document breaks down the architecture blueprint into actionable milestones. The goal is to build the service iteratively while maintaining a deployable state at the end of each phase.

## Phase 0 – Project Scaffolding
- **Repository setup**
  - Initialize Rust workspace with separate crates for `server`, `runtime`, and `common` utilities.
  - Configure toolchain (`rust-toolchain.toml`, `rustfmt`, `clippy`).
- **CI bootstrap**
  - Add GitHub Actions workflow for lint + unit tests on push/PR.
- **Baseline documentation**
  - Expand `README` with architecture overview and local development instructions.

## Phase 1 – HTTP Surface & Request Lifecycle Skeleton
- **Server crate**
  - Introduce Axum (or Actix) based HTTP server with routing, middleware, and health endpoints.
  - Implement request context extraction (headers, cookies, trace IDs).
- **Common crate**
  - Define shared types: `RenderMode`, `RouteConfig`, error enums.
- **Observability groundwork**
  - Add structured logging (tracing crate) and expose Prometheus metrics endpoint.
- **Integration tests**
  - Verify health/readiness endpoints and base routing.

## Phase 2 – Data Orchestration Layer
- **Data providers abstraction**
  - Define trait-based interface for async data sources with timeouts/cancellation support.
  - Implement mock providers + in-memory cache prototype.
- **Request pipeline integration**
  - Compose data fetch orchestrator into router flow, ensure context propagation.
- **Error handling**
  - Add circuit-breaker scaffolding and typed errors for upstream failures.

## Phase 3 – V8 Runtime Integration
- **Runtime crate**
  - Add V8 bindings (using `rusty_v8`) and isolate pool manager skeleton.
  - Implement snapshot loader + module resolver interfacing with bundle registry stub.
- **Render bridge**
  - Expose Rust ↔ JS bindings for logging, data fetch invocation, and streaming callbacks.
- **Resource controls**
  - Enforce isolate limits (heap, execution time) and pooling configuration via config file.
- **Testing**
  - Add unit tests around isolate lifecycle (using mock bundle) and integration test covering end-to-end render invocation with sample JS.

## Phase 4 – Response Composition & Streaming
- **HTML composer**
  - Implement streaming response writer combining template shell with V8 output chunks.
  - Support both full-buffered and streaming modes.
- **Cache strategy**
  - Integrate in-memory cache for rendered fragments; design hooks for distributed cache.
- **Error fallbacks**
  - Add server-side error boundary rendering and log correlation.

## Phase 5 – Artifact & Configuration Management
- **Bundle registry adapter**
  - Define interface for retrieving SSR bundles (local filesystem to start).
  - Implement snapshot builder CLI for generating pre-warmed isolates.
- **Configuration system**
  - Load route manifests, feature flags, and environment config from TOML/YAML.
- **Hot reload / management API**
  - Expose endpoints or CLI commands to refresh bundles and clear caches.

## Phase 6 – Advanced Observability & Hardening
- **Metrics expansion**
  - Capture render latency histograms, cache hit rates, isolate pool utilization.
- **Distributed tracing**
  - Integrate OpenTelemetry for tracing across data fetch and render stages.
- **Security passes**
  - Implement rate limiting, input validation, and tighten sandboxed capabilities.
- **Load testing & profiling**
  - Add scripts/instructions for benchmarking and capturing V8 heap/CPU profiles.

## Phase 7 – Deployment Pipeline
- **Containerization**
  - Create multi-stage Dockerfile including V8 dependencies and runtime snapshots.
- **Kubernetes manifests**
  - Draft Helm chart or Kustomize overlays for deployment, including config maps and autoscaling hints.
- **Release process**
  - Document blue/green rollout procedure leveraging bundle versioning.

## Phase 8 – Stretch Goals / Future Work
- Incremental static regeneration task queue integration.
- Edge rendering variant targeting WASM-compatible isolates.
- Developer tooling (CLI) for template validation and local render replay.

## Milestone Acceptance Criteria
Each phase should produce:
1. Passing CI (lint + tests) demonstrating the new functionality.
2. Updated documentation covering usage and operations.
3. Observability instrumentation sufficient to debug that layer.

Tracking progress via GitHub Projects or Issues is recommended; create tickets per bullet to enable parallel work and clear ownership.
